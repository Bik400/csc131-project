# CSC 131 Project - Fall 2021

Simplify the data entry process for CalTrans workers.

## Description

### Project Vision:
The class of CSC 131-01 would like to simplify the documentation process for CalTrans site inspections.
To effectively accomplish this goal, we must make the existing Caltrans Construction Project Stormwater Review Report more interactive, so as to expedite inspection reports for Caltrans personnel.


### Project Objectives:
Reduce the time investment required to accomplish each task in the report.
Protect the user from themselves- make forgiving software that anticipates human mistakes.
The program shall seek to simplify the input of redundant information.
